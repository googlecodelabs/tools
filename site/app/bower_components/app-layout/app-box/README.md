##&lt;app-box&gt;

app-box is a container element that can have scroll effects - visual effects based on
scroll position. For example, the parallax effect can be used to move an image at a slower
rate than the foreground.

```html
<app-box style="height: 100px;" effects="parallax-background">
  <img background src="picture.png" style="width: 100%; height: 600px;">
</app-box>
```

Notice the `background` attribute in the `img` element; this attribute specifies that that
image is used as the background. By adding the background to the light dom, you can compose
backgrounds that can change dynamically. Alternatively, the mixin `--app-box-background-front-layer`
 allows to style the background. For example:

```css
  .parallaxAppBox {
    --app-box-background-front-layer: {
      background-image: url(picture.png);
    };
  }
```

Finally, app-box can have content inside. For example:

```html
<app-box effects="parallax-background">
  <h2>Sub title</h2>
</app-box>
```

#### Importing the effects

To use the scroll effects, you must explicitly import them in addition to `app-box`:

```html
<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/app-layout/app-scroll-effects/app-scroll-effects.html">
```

#### List of effects

* **parallax-background**
A simple parallax effect that vertically translates the backgrounds based on a fraction
of the scroll position. For example:

```css
app-header {
  --app-header-background-front-layer: {
    background-image: url(...);
  };
}
```
```html
<app-header style="height: 300px;" effects="parallax-background">
  <app-toolbar>App name</app-toolbar>
</app-header>
```

The fraction determines how far the background moves relative to the scroll position.
This value can be assigned via the `scalar` config value and it is typically a value
between 0 and 1 inclusive. If `scalar=0`, the background doesn't move away from the header.
