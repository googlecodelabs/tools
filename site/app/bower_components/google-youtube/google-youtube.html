`google-youtube` encapsulates the YouTube player into a web component.

    <google-youtube
      video-id="..."
      height="270px"
      width="480px"
      rel="0"
      start="5"
      autoplay="1">
    </google-youtube>

`google-youtube` supports all of the [embedded player parameters](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters). Each can be set as an attribute on `google-youtube`.

The standard set of [YouTube player events](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Events) are exposed, as well as methods for playing, pausing, seeking to a specific time, and loading a new video.


Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--google-youtube-container`  | Mixin applied to the container div | `{}`
`--google-youtube-thumbnail`  | Mixin for the video thumbnail      | `{}`
`--google-youtube-iframe`     | Mixin for the embeded iframe       | `{}`
