# How to Write a Codelab
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 1

### What You’ll Learn 
- how to set the amount of time each slide will take to finish 
- how to include code snippets 
- how to hyperlink items 
- how to include images 
- other stuff

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Setting Duration
Duration: 2

To indicate how long each slide will take to go through, set the `Duration` under each Heading 2 (i.e. `##`) to an integer. 
The integers refer to minutes. If you set `Duration: 4` then a particular slide will take 4 minutes to complete. 

The total time will automatically be calculated for you and will be displayed on the codelab once you create it.

## Code Snippets
Duration: 3

To include code snippets you can do a few things. 
- Inline highlighting can be done using the tiny tick mark on your keyboard: "`"
- Embedded code
